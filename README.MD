# SQLForge

SQLForge is a Java-based tool designed to generate SQL scripts for database operations, supporting basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It uses the **Faker** library to create realistic test data, making it ideal for quick setup of test databases or automating data manipulation scripts.
